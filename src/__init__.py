This package serves as the root of the application.

It organizes the main components and layers of the project, following the principles
of Clean Architecture. The structure ensures a clear separation of concerns and
maintains modularity, scalability, and testability.

Sub-packages include:
- `domain`: Core business logic and entities.
- `use_cases`: Application-specific use cases.
- `interface`: Input/output mechanisms such as APIs and schemas.
- `infra`: Infrastructure implementations like databases and external services.
