"""
This package contains the domain layer of the application.

The domain layer is the core of the application and is responsible for defining
the business logic and entities. It is independent of external systems, frameworks,
or infrastructure, ensuring that the core logic remains isolated and reusable.

Components in this package include domain models, interfaces, and business rules.
