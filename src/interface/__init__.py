"""
This package contains the interface layer of the application.

The interface layer is responsible for handling communication between the
application and external systems, such as APIs, user interfaces, or other
input/output mechanisms. It defines how the application exposes its functionality
to the outside world.

Components in this package include routers, controllers, and schemas for
data validation and serialization.
