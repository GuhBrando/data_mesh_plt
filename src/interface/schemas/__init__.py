"""
This package contains the schemas used for data validation and serialization.

The schemas in this package are typically implemented using Pydantic and are
used to define the structure of data exchanged between the application and
external systems, such as API requests and responses.

These schemas should not contain business logic and are primarily used for
data validation and transformation purposes.
