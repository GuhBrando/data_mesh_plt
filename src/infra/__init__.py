"""
This package contains the infrastructure layer of the application.

The infrastructure layer is responsible for implementing the details of external
systems, such as databases, APIs, and other third-party services. It provides
the necessary implementations to support the application's use cases and domain logic.

Components in this package should depend on abstractions defined in the domain
or use case layers, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
