"""
This package contains the infrastructure models used in the application.

The models in this package are typically tied to specific frameworks or libraries,
such as ORM models (e.g., SQLAlchemy) or other data representations that interact
with external systems like databases or APIs.

These models should not contain business logic and are primarily used for
persistence or integration purposes.
